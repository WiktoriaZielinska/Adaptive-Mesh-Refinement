### Step 2: Go to the official VisIt download page: [VisIt Releases](https://visit-dav.github.io/visit-website/releases-as-tables/).

### Step 3: Identify the correct version for your operating system (Windows, Mac, or Linux).

In this example, I was using a Windows laptop, so I installed **Version 3.3.3 from March 2023**, even though it wasnâ€™t the latest version.

### Step 4: After installation is complete, launch VisIt.

### Step 5: During the launching process, you will be prompted to choose a lab. Select **"Oak Ridge National Laboratory"** from the options.

### Step 6: On the left side under **"Hosts"**, select **"ORNL_Andes"**.

### Step 7: Change the **"Username"** field to match the username you used to log into Frontier (Your **UCAMS username**).

### Step 8: Once the username is entered, click **"Post"** to proceed. Your screen should resemble the following:

### Step 10: Continue through the rest of the VisIt tutorial until you feel comfortable using the software. You should try to create at least one visualization: [VisIt Training Series](https://github.com/olcf/dva-training-series/tree/main/visit#download)

### Step 11: Congratulations! You are now ready to move on to the next step!
